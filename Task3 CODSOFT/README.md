# CODSOFT - Task 2  ( Iris Flower Species Classification )

## Summary

This machine learning project aims to categorize iris flowers into one of three species - setosa, versicolor or virginica based on attributes like sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The data is loaded from a CSV file containing records of 150 iris flowers with their measurements.

After loading and exploring the data, preprocessing steps like encoding the categorical target variable are taken. The data is split into training and testing sets. A KNearestNeighbors Classifier model is trained on the training data to predict the iris species.

The performance of the model is evaluated on the testing data using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report. Additionally, the trained model can be used to classify new iris samples into species based on their measurements.

The report includes details of the model building and testing process along with sample outputs. Relevant data visualizations are also provided using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the distributions of different measurements across species.
