# CODSOFT - Task 5  ( Credit Card Fraud Detection )

## Summary

This machine learning project leverages a Logistic Regression classifier to identify fraudulent transactions from a dataset containing thousands of anonymized credit card purchases labeled as fraud or genuine. By training on features like V1 to V28 along with visualization-driven exploration of differences in patterns for the two transaction classes, a predictive classification model is developed that can reliably flag potential frauds based on learned data regularities. 

The implementation workflow involves data preprocessing, train-test split, model training and evaluation stages - using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn across them. With the built model achieving a 95% test accuracy in correctly categorizing new unlabeled transactions, this project demonstrates the applicability of ML to augment credit card fraud detection rates greatly compared to traditional rule-based approaches, providing a launchpad for further optimization.
