# CODSOFT - Task 4  ( Sales Prediction using python )

## Summary

This machine learning project leverages a linear regression algorithm to predict product sales numbers based on advertising spending inputs across media like TV, radio and newspaper.

It uses a dataset of historical ad spends and actual sales to train a model that captures the correlation between these input budgets and output sales. After exploring the data graphically for insights, splitting into train-test sets, and fitting a regression line, the model can estimate sales given new proposed TV, radio and newspaper budgets. With good model performance demonstrated via R-squared evaluation, this demonstration of sales forecasting via ML can assist marketers in optimally allocating advertising expenditure across channels to maximize expected sales. 

The core libraries used include Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization and modeling.
