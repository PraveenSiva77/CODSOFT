# CODSOFT - Task 1  ( Titanic Survival Prediction Project )

## Summary

This machine learning project aims to predict the survival outcome (survived or did not survive) of passengers on the Titanic based on certain attributes like passenger class, gender, age, fare etc. The data is loaded from a CSV file containing records of each passenger.

After loading and exploring the data, preprocessing steps like encoding the gender column are taken. The data is split into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Classifier model is trained on the training data to predict the survival status.

The performance of the model is evaluated on the testing data using metrics like accuracy and classification report. Additionally, the project provides the capability for custom user testing by taking inputs of gender and passenger class and returning the predicted survival outcome.

The report includes details of the model building and testing process along with sample inputs and outputs. Relevant data visualizations are also provided using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the relationships between variables like class, gender and survival rates on the Titanic.
