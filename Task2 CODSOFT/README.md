# CODSOFT - Task 2  ( Movie Rating Prediction with Python )

## Summary

This machine learning project aims to predict the IMDb rating of movies based on certain attributes like release year, number of votes, duration, director, and actors. The data is loaded from a CSV file containing records of over 5000 movies.

After loading and exploring the data, preprocessing steps like handling missing values and encoding categorical variables are taken. The data is split into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on the training data to predict the movie rating.

The performance of the model is evaluated on the testing data using metrics like R-squared score. Additionally, the project provides the capability for custom user testing by taking inputs of a hypothetical movie and returning the predicted IMDb rating.

The report includes details of the model building and testing process along with sample inputs and outputs. Relevant data visualizations are also provided using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand the relationships between variables like directors, actors and average movie ratings.
